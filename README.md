# lightcrs

Lightweight pure python implementation of WGS84-based coordinate reference systems and their conversions for Lat/Lon, UTM and MGRS.

MGRS-conversion only works for UTM at the moment. An implementation for the universal polar stereographic (UPS) coordinate system for north and south pole MGRS mapping is missing.
