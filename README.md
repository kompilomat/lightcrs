# lightcrs

Lightweight python implementation of a WGS84 coordinate reference system for Lat/Lon, UTM and MGRS conversion.

MGRS-conversion only works for UTM at the moment. An implementation for the universal polar stereographic (UPS) coordinate system for north and south pole MGRS mapping is missing.
